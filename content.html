  <p>Ada Lovelace was one of the influential mathematicians and English writers of her time. She has written instructions for the first computer program in the mid 1800s. She also wrote the program for Charles Babbage’s mechanical computer, the analytical engine.</p>

  <h2>Early Life</h2>

  <p>Ada Lovelace was born in London, England, UK on December 10, 1815. She was named Augusta Ada Byron</p>


  <h2>Analytical inspiration</h2>

  <p>In 1842 Ada Lovelace heard of a paper called Sketch of Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine, by Luigi Federico Menabrea, an engineer. The paper was written in French.

Menabrea had listened to lectures by Babbage and written them up. By this time, Babbage had moved on from the difference engine to a much higher level computer concept, the analytical engine.

The analytical engine would be capable of much more sophisticated calculations than the original difference engine</p>
